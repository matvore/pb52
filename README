pb52: Filter output from your shell to make Terminal.app OSC 52-capable

This simple tool makes Terminal.app capable of copying/pasting text with the
OSC 52 escape sequence. Terminal.app is a perfectly fine terminal emulator for
many use cases except for its omission of OSC 52 support, so this tool may save
you from downloading alternative terminal emulators.

To compile, you need Xcode Command-Line Tools installed. You can compile like this:

  $ gcc -O3 -o pb52 pb52.c

Then run like this if you are ssh-ing to a remote machine:

  $ ssh some-machine | ./pb52

Or like this to use it locally with bash:

  $ bash -l | ./pb52
